**DESCRIPTION**

Read The Open Group Service Integration Maturity Model (OSIMM) Version 2

(http://www.opengroup.org/soa/source-book/osimmv2/) and answer the following questions:



**1.How many maturity levels are defined by the standard?**

http://www.opengroup.org/soa/source-book/osimmv2/p2.htm

There are defined seven levels of maturity, ranging from one to seven, that in ascending order represent the agility of a business. But each business should suit their OSIMM level to their organisation, and not strive for the upper most level.

The seven SOA maturity levels are:

Level 1: Silo

Level 2: Integrated

Level 3: Componentized

Level 4: Service

Level 5: Composite Services

Level 6: Virtualized Services

Level 7: Dynamically Re-Configurable Services


**2.Which are the maturity dimensions, used as indicators for assessment of the maturity levels?**

http://www.opengroup.org/soa/source-book/osimmv2/p2.htm

OSIMM defines a set of dimensions, representing different views (e.g., business, architectural) of an organization, as follows:

* Business - Focused on business architecture, current practices and processes.

* Organization & Governance - Focused on the structure, design and management of the organisation it self.

* Method - Focused on methods and processes of business development and Software Development Lifecycle maturity.

* Application - Focused on the application style, modularity and reusability, and current implementation.

* Architecture - Focused on the structure of the architecture.

* Information - Focused on the quality of data that is accumulated.

* Infrastructure & Management - Focused on how operations are managed and reflected upon afterwards.
